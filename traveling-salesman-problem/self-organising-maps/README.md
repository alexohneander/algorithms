# Self-Organising Map (SOM) Implementation

This repository provides a Python implementation of a Self-Organising Map (SOM), also known as a Kohonen Map. SOMs are a type of unsupervised neural network that learns to represent high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional (typically 2D) grid, preserving the topological
relationships within the data.

**Project Description:**

This project demonstrates the core principles of SOMs, including:

* **Competitive Learning:**  The algorithm uses a competitive learning rule to update the weights of the nodes in the grid based on the similarity of the input data to the nodes.
* **Neighborhood Function:**  A neighborhood function determines the influence of a node on its neighbors during the learning process.
* **Grid Topology:**  The project uses a standard rectangular grid topology for the SOM.

**Implementation Details:**

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** [List the libraries you're using - e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib]
* **Algorithm:** [Specify the exact algorithm you're using - e.g., "Basic SOM with Gaussian neighborhood function."]

**Example Use Cases:**

* **Data Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual data points.
* **Feature Extraction:**  Creating new features from the data.
