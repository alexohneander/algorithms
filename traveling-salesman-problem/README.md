# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This repository contains a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem.  The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

**Problem Description:**

Given a set of cities represented by coordinates (x, y), the TSP aims to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.  The distance between two cities is typically calculated using the Euclidean distance (straight-line
distance).

**Implementation Details:**

* [Describe your algorithm here - e.g., "This project implements a brute-force solution for small problem sizes," or "This uses a branch and bound approach," or "This utilizes a genetic algorithm."]
* [Mention any libraries or frameworks you're using - e.g., "Uses the `networkx` library for graph representation."]

**Key Concepts:**

* **NP-Hard:** The problem is computationally very difficult for large numbers of cities.
* **Heuristics:**  Due to the complexity, practical solutions often rely on heuristics to find near-optimal solutions.
* **Algorithms:**  Brute-Force, Branch and Bound, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, Nearest Neighbor, Christofides Algorithm.

**Applications:**

* Vehicle Routing
* Logistics Optimization
* Tour Design
* Scheduling
